# react-native-start
React Native Starter Kit
Welcome to my React Native Starter Kit! This repo contains a collection of small apps and projects that I built while learning React Native.

Each app is stored in a separate repository within this main repo, called react-native-start. This allows me to keep each project separate and organized, while still having them all in one place.

Getting Started
To get started with this repo, you will need to have Node.js and Expo CLI installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website, and install Expo CLI using the following command:

Copy code
npm install -g expo-cli
Once you have installed Node.js and Expo CLI, you can clone this repository using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<username>/react-native-start.git
After cloning the repo, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

Copy code
npm install
To run an app, navigate to its respective directory and run the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the Expo development server and open a new tab in your web browser with the Expo dashboard.

From here, you can choose to run the app on an iOS or Android simulator, or on your physical device using the Expo app. You can also use the QR code scanner to run the app on your device.

Projects
This repo contains several projects that I built while learning React Native. Each project is stored in a separate repository within the react-native-start folder.
